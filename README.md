# TCET College Pracs
Consist of all Subjects Practical Codes for all Experiments of COMPS Department TCET.
# Why?
Simply to avoid last minute rush of asking someone for the code or delaying submission to next week simply because noone in your class prepared the experiment.There are also some times where you just don't know where to start or you might want to revise (or copy o_O ) the codes in one go.Even my batchmayes were having trouble to complete their submission on time. 
# Need help?
While I have tried to get all the codes I can,I understand that the syllabus in the recent years have been merged/changed or straight away crossed from the syllabus so if you need help you can create issues of subjects/code that u dont see up here.**There are some subjects which have been transferred to another semester so before you ask for a specific subject do check on other folders and files before raising an issue**
# Want to Contribute?
You are always welcome to contribute to this repo,just create a valid pull req,I will verify and add it to the main tree.

Happy coding :)
