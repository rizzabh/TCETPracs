# TCET College Pracs
Consist of all Subjects Practical Codes for  all Experiments of COMPS Department TCET.
# Why?
Simply to avoid last minute rush of asking someone for the code or delaying submission to next week simply because noone in your class prepared the experiment.There are also some times where you just don't know where to start or you might want to revise (or copy o_O ) the codes in one go.Even my batchmayes were having trouble to complete their submission on time.
